1.  I value all the moments in my life, no matter good or bad, depressing or joyful. Besides taking photos, I record them by writing diaries, and filming videos. It has been 13 years since I formed the habit of writing diaries as a middle school student. I boutght an [OSMO Pocket](\files\pdf\Osmo_Pocket) and became a vlogger in Apr. 2019. [This](https://youtu.be/sK4xFoP8GiQ) is one of my vlog shot in Jul. 2019 when I traveled to Houston. 
2. I am a BIG fan of the movie series [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)) and [*The Lord of the Rings*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)), which set in the [fictional world of Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_in_film). In particular, [Aragorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragorn) is my favorite role, brave, tenacity, and loyal to friends.
3. My leisure time is mainly spent on [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&node=154606011), [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) and working out. My favorite books so far are [*Ordinary World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_World_(novel)), and [*A Song of Ice and Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire). 

    For switch, [*Spiritfarer*](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/spiritfarer-switch/) is the most touching game I have ever played, which is related to hospice care. My favourite game is [*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/), I like the feeling to take adventure on the mainland of Hyrule with my shining Master Sword and Master Cycle Zero. 
    
    To maintain good physical and mental health, I do exercise regularly like hiking, and boxing, etc. I took [this photo](\files\fig\Victoria_Peak.jpg) when hiking Victoria Peak in May 2020.
4. I do **not** think I am a very talented researcher, but certain that I am a down-to-earth and a hardworking one :P.
