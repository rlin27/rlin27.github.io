Welcome! Now I am job hunting as a fresh graduate :D.

I earned my Ph.D. degree in September 2022 at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (EEE), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and Prof. [Graziano Chesi](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~chesi/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/) from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

My current research interests include neural network compression for deployments of DNNs on edge devices, efficient training, tensor applications for computation & memory cost reduction, and transformer in computer vision field. I also have research enthusiasm in model robustness analysis, graph learning and control system. 

Welcome to contact me if you are interested in either of these topics!
