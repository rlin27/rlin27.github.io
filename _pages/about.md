Welcome! I am a Researcher (2022.12 - present) in the AI Framework & Data Tech. Lab, Huawei Hong Kong Research Center. In the current stage, our R&D areas include explainable and trustworthy AI, data processing technologies, framework design, and innovative software architecture design based on these innovations. Our R&D product contexts include Huawei's AI framework (MindSpore), cloud-native software, serverless computing stack, etc.

Before I joined Huawei, I earned my Ph.D. degree in September 2022 at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (EEE), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/) and Prof. [Graziano Chesi](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~chesi/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/) from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

My current research interests include neural network compression for deployments of DNNs on edge devices, efficient training, tensor applications for computation & memory cost reduction. I also have research enthusiasm in model robustness analysis, graph learning and database. 

Welcome to contact me if you are interested in our lab or either of those research topics!
